# Learning Lab

Welcome to **Learning Lab**! This repository is my personal learning space where I explore, experiment, and practice coding with multiple technologies. Currently, it includes projects and exercises focused on Python and JavaScript, structured by language and course to keep track of progress.

## Overview

This repository is divided into sections for different languages, with subfolders containing exercises, projects, and sample code as I learn. Each file or folder represents a lesson or project that helped me understand new concepts and build my skillset.

**Currently covered technologies:**
- **Python**: Projects and exercises from _Learn Python 3 the Hard Way_ and Python PCAP Associate prep.
- **JavaScript**: Beginner exercises to explore syntax, logic, and the fundamentals.

## Folder Structure

Here’s an overview of the folder structure:

```
├── LICENSE
├── README.md
├── js                      # JavaScript projects and exercises
└── python                  # Python learning resources
    ├── learn_python_3_the_hard_way
    │   ├── [exercises by lesson number and topic]
    └── prep-python-pcap-associate
        ├── [exercises and mini-projects for certification prep]
        ├── data_types.ipynb
        └── print.ipynb
```

Each folder is organized by exercise or project title, making it easy to track my learning journey step-by-step. 

## Getting Started

Feel free to explore the code! Each folder includes standalone scripts or Jupyter notebooks, so you can run any exercise or project directly to see the output. This setup lets me break down complex topics into manageable lessons.
